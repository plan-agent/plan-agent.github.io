PLAN Lab stands for **Personal Linked Agent Network Lab**.

The name highlights four core ideas:
- **Personal**: human-centered intelligence and personalized agent services.
- **Linked**: strong interoperability and structured connections among agents.
- **Agent**: autonomous, collaborative, and adaptive intelligent entities.
- **Network**: large-scale connected ecosystems, or the **Agent Internet**.

The word **PLAN** also represents blueprint thinking and long-term system design. Our vision is not isolated agents, but interoperable agent networks that can support next-generation standards, infrastructure, and real-world applications.

PLAN Lab is also known in Chinese as **普兰实验室 / 蓝图实验室**.
